# 3. Why tests

Date: 2021-12-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The second half of day 1 uses the first haljf, so I wondered if the entire thing is like that.

If we don't have tests then we can refactor.

We'll need to refactor in order to satisfy the next problem(s).

## Decision

Use tests instead of cli.

## Consequences

Allow safe reuse of the solutions to prior problems.

## Risks

If every day is independent then this is waste. (?)
